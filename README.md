# Audio Engine

This repository contains a Blackjack Game (no graphic display) that implements an Audio Engine built in from scratch in C++ using FMOD low-level API.

The Audio Manager class handles loading, playing and stopping songs and effects, as well as managing the volume of the channels, fades in and out, generating random volume and pitch values within a range (to make sfxs less repetitive), setting up the listener properties and setting up a 3D reverb environement.
